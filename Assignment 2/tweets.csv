$50 to upgrade to A7 from B54 on a 5:30 LAS-&gt;BWI == No Brainer after this week! Thanks
my flight has been delayed from orig. departure time of 8:55 to 10:45. Do I have to adhere to the original time to drop off my bags and arrive to the gate or the new time works? #airport #delays
"Currently on flight 2829 delayed over and hour, re-parked to kickoff a passenger that they 15 mins later let back on. No offer of drinks or food... terrible. Should have flown"
not your best day. You all need to figure out whats going on at Midway. You canceled my flight for fog. The news just said there was a a 25 minute ground delay
you are the real deal <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BC><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BC>
kudos to the flight attendants on #305 especially Susie and Brittany. Susie was so sweet she allowed me to use her personal creamer for my coffee. Nothing better than flying Southwest Airlines!
"despite the chaos at MDW today, thank you for manning the gates to try and get us out!"
I love what a pleasant eerience I always have with you. Miles difference from every other airline I fly with. You arrived late to Milwaukee and still got us into BNA on time. On to fun times in Nashville for my 40th!
Stuck on #flight 1889 in Phoenix cause they dont have a person to run jetway. Seriously an hour late already. #airlines
My dad flies 90+ a year. A-list preferred. Had flight from MDW to PHX canceled due to fog MDW. Tried 2 call 2 rebook. Was told had 2 rebook thru an agent bc of chkd bags. WHY?? Waited in line for 2 hours. By that time next available flight 2 PHX was 2 days later.
"I have been flying southwest with my family since I was 3 months old. Today, you canceled my lacrosse teams flight from DTW to LAX &amp; did nothing to fix the situation. stepped in and created an entire layover for us at LGB. I am very disappointed in you guys"
Ive flown airlines all over the world and the boarding process is still the best and most efficient.
flight attendant told whole plane to be kind to one another upon landing. #preach <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008A><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00AF><U+2714><U+FE0F>
on flight 1482 Houston to St Louis. I LUV Southwest however not getting LUV from your crew on this flight. First ever complaint. RR#: 32857086 A-list preferred and Companion Pass. Seat A3. Learning opportunity
"I appreciate your generosity. However, I appreciated more the time you spent to fix your CS issues &amp; listening to feedback."
should be ashamed of themselves for the mess they created at MDW today. I understand fog but how are other airlines able to not cancel all flights from the same airport!!! Should have booked smh lesson learned. Never again
Love when strands us with no way to get to LA. CU baseball would love to get to LA soon so if you could send a plane that would be great. #southwest #getmeoutofhere
I have had it with SW. I pay for early check in and always get B group on my return flights. Worse than that is my wife did not pay and she got assigned to board before I do. This process is absurd! No more SW.
hey boo! Been a while but just had a quick question. How does one acquire drink vouchers for future flights? I have a few summer trips planned <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
"The Yale men's lacrosse team is on my flight and the flight attendant who just said, ""Good luck, fellas. You're all good lookin'!"" on the loudspeaker is my spirit animal."
"Omw to the airport. I forgot my drink coupons, and there isn't enough time to go back home and get them"
thank you for stranding my friend in Atlanta and screwing her over for days on end.
"So disappointed in you guys to the point where I'm livid. I liked flying you guys, but I doubt I will anymore. You canceled my flight mere hours before it was to leave. I tried to get a flight out of a different airport, but I was going to get charged?!!"
whats going on with flight 1131 from las to sfo? Weve been boarded for over 40 minutes now and the plane still hasnt moved.
"#1283 MCI to LAX, Megan is as good as it gets! Thank you for all that you do to make sure we have an exceptional eerience!"
still waiting
this delay is killing me bruh
Flights booked!! Hotel booked! #laMarathon were coming for you! #werunsocial
Its a crazy day for travel by this guy was the epitome of cool! He got me on my way. I even talked him into a super brief hello for #Twitter! Lol. <U+2708><U+FE0F> #Luv

flight 6328 crew doing an amazing job managing ridiculous passangers. Always a pleasure seeing professionals in their element.
we looked up flights to minneapolis from milwaukee. Why would you have such a dumb scheduled. It is faster to drive there.
both my flights to &amp; from Phoenix were delayed an hour today. Certainly does not motivate me to choose you as my airline of choice for these trips. If you care. #FYI
Lost my A list preferred boarding second week in a row due to a delayed connection. Why not hold the boarding? #NotDone
i hope you guys accommodate customers when they have a horrible eerience. if not youve lost two frequent flyers.
<f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+00AC><f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+00AC>Oh not to mention its 5 oclock here and just told us we have to wait at least four to five hours to get our luggage from a flight that has been at the airport since 7 this morning! I am pissed! This has literally been the worst eerience of my life!#YouSuck
"Thanks, Captain hasn't given us any info for 25 minutes."
. being charged $100 When I have an $800 voucher on a $773 flight. Shouldn't I only be charged tax? Halp.
when will thanksgiving 2018 flights be available?
No WiFi on flight 481 and I was looking forward to the watching the #Olympics....bummer
My flight was just delayed talking about a weather advisory. I'm standing at rainless snowless 44 ass Midway right now. Wtf
Donna the supervisor down in baggage claim at MDW is amazing...very long day (11hrs no bags) and she is the only one taking the time to actually listen to and help every customer she has encountered.
We love the crew of Flight 8 from PDX to DEN. So much humor and positivity. Please pass along our praise!
"I love you and I appreciate you so much but weve been cancelled, rebooked, cancelled, and now delayed for over 9 hours today and were so tired is this ordeal worth at least a couple hundred rapid rewards points lol"
"Honestly u make us get on plane, wait 30 minutes to tell us the pilot running late, and hour later we're still waiting? Really? #patience ahh? #yaright"
"I know you're not responsible for weather, , but you could have at least given me a toothbrush."
Big Sigh ! Stuck in Las Vegas due to mechanical issues! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0096> wont get home until the wee hours of tomorrow! 3+ hour delay......
Luv SWA but disappointed with present flight. Traveling Biz class.
Flying alone for the first time in my life tomorrow on and I forgot to check-in 24 hours ahead...catc
"3.5 hour delay with no elanation, no WiFi or drink tickets? flight 5869"
"Ive had a fear of flying, specifically taking off, for some time now. Thanks to the great pilots on my flight from LA to SF for talking me through the takeoff process and helping me calm my fears."
WIFI isnt even worth a penny.
A huge thank you to Delaney at the ATL Baggage Claim customer service for helping my son as his fights were cancelled to Detroit. She secured a hotel voucher and meal vouchers for him. She also made arrangements for his luggage to hopefully now arrive in Cincinnati.
it would be great if I could track my bag thru the app like Delta #wheresmybag
"if you check into a flight and get spot c24, is it worth even going? should you just cancel your flight? give up? die?"
"This time next week well be in the air headed to California. Its been a while, . Cant wait to see you again."
I luv . You can pick where you sit and who you sit beside. Awesome day at #SouthwestAirlines
you delay flight 250 twice from Milwaukee to Baltimore then you make us change gates. And now we STILL have not pulled away from the gate. It's almost 9pm. I thought you guys were the good airline. How about a promo code to use the onboard wi-fi for our trouble?
"Shout out to for the delayed flights, lack of pilots etc. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1> #neveragain"
#nice job with the $100 voucher to all LAS to BHM passengers for a 2.5hr delay one of the reasons I only fly with the #best
"Have been on hold now for 17 minutes. My wait time was ""less than 2 minutes"" when I connected. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0>"

flight from Phoenix already about an hour delayed now waiting for a 45 minute software upload. It's all about timing. Sigh!
in PHX going to MCI already delayed an hour and now they announce maintenance wants to do a software upload.... Already delayed an hour what is another 45 minutes??? You had been doing on such a roll the last few trips...
is it common practice to delay a flight waiting for one passenger?
You have to do something about obese people on flights. Three hour flight leaning into an isle because a huge person sits in the middle seat and takes up half of the isle and window seat. Not going to fly with you if my back and hip are going to hurt because of it.
Thanks for getting me to LA! It was a bumpy one but service was fab!
Flight 2015 for still sitting on ground. No weather. Supposed to leave 45 minutes ago
We are taking a family trip to SLC. Gotta connect through Vegas from SD. My brothers turn 11 today and the captain made a great announcement. Thanks SWA for making the bday that much better for them <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+00A9>

no non stop aus to sea anymore!?
do u have any plans to open up more than 2 non-stop flights from PHL to MCO in Aug??
Can you fix your app to still show delayed flights after they were supposed to land? If I hadn't screen shotted my boarding pass I'd be screwed right now.
Spectacular end to a great day. Thank you &amp; Sky Harbor Airport for giving my father a grand send off on his last flight. 8

"Thanks for making $53 worth of travel funds eire 7 months after purchase (purchased May 31, 2017, eired JAN 31, 2018). because I used $7.96 of prior travel funds on a $158.98 ticket. Been a loyal flyer for years but I may have to look into other options."
sitting on a plane in Tulsa at 1126pm. Been here for over 10 min. What's going on with your operations? SMH
I don't understand how you can't find my hat that was lost during the evacuation of our plan yet you were able to find a lost book on the same flight if supposedly the whole plane was searched. Are people actually looking? Flight 2123 out of SNA
Bags didnt make it on my flight. Blah. But very helpful people at the desk for who will call when they come- hopefully on the next flight from Oakland. On the shuttle to get to the hotel to pick up my badge at lest.
So my kid was on this flight. Care to elain two aborted landings ?
What bag claim did flight 665 from oma to Denver use?
So I sat in Alanta airport from 8am this morning . Chicago's flights cancelled. put me on a flight to Milwaukee. AND GUESS WHAT?!? Those mofs LOST my bags<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1> After sitting a WHOLE DAY...You have LOST a valuable customer.
Hey due to being delayed on your flight I missed out on a meeting with people out in CA that could have made my move to England happen. Now I had to change my flight to go home early and that cost me an additional $200. Thanks so much for messing that up. Terrible

i need to correct middle initial on booking I just made.
Heres a new one for you ... mechanical delays made us miss our transfer. Our hotel vouchers werent recognized/validated at the hotel as they were oversold. Its 2am and were a mess. Not a fun evening guys... love you all but ouch. This one is BAD.
was my favorite airline until this week Im over it
i love flying with i literally wouldnt want to fly any other way

LAST TIME I WILL BE FLYING ON SOUTHWEST. Half of the flight showed up 10 minutes late bc of security and the flight next door was boarding at 6am when they were suppose to take off. Dont attach bonuses to number of flights that take off on time. #losecustomers
"I'm curious, I checked in 24 hours on the dot. Someone else did it minutes later and got a better boarding position than me. How does that work?"
your service was deplorable yesterday. I missed my Mom's 80th birthday because of them. I was stuck in Kansas BFE City. I had to fly back home because they eected me to stand around untilthis afternoon to fly again. No hotel suggestions. You SUCK
More reason to fly out of #Nashville airport. is the best.
is celebrating their new ATL-BNA (Nashville) route by offering $19 one way fares. $19. And that includes two checked bags. Incredible.
now has flights from Atlanta to Nashville for as low as $19 This is incredible!!
thank you for the direct flights to and from Nashville and Atlanta! Now when will we see the Aloha state flights?
"Got bumped from our flight to Denver, but shout out to the gate agents Melissa and Kimberly for getting us all straightened out. Awesome service!"

Thanks EWR Operations for literally finding us another plane to get to Chicago. 2 hours delay reduced to 45 mins through working together. This is why I love you guys!!!
"do you not have a line for regular full service check ins? I get that people who pay more should have one dedicated line, but all of them is excessive! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
"Y'all! My flight crew this am is DOING THE MOST! It's amusing, , just make sure we get there safely. T"
When did it become acceptable to board the airplane without your child? I purchased early bird so I can board with my family and was told today that we all have to have matching boarding groups? This has never happened before. Seeking refund.

Very unhappy with the no wifi situation on flight 1994 to Denver. What can you do to make this right?
this is ridiculous... you all cancelled our flights to LA... then rebooked is for 24 hours later... this is so sad.. never flying with you ever again

would be nice if I paid for WiFi and it actually stayed on. Not one time on a flight this year has there been stable service including right now. Off and on 3 times now.Just handing you 8 bucks!
I guess you get what you pay for. #NeverFlyFrontier I miss you
"has really regressed lately. They cancelled my friends flight, he booked a later flight which got delayed, then cancelled because they forgot San Diego had a curfew. Didnt offer to help my friend at all. One of many bad eeriences lately. Do not fly Southwest!!!"

Very disappointed in the customer service yesterday. Very unorganized. No empathy. Made an inconvenient situation more frustrating. Definitely not what I was eecting from an airline that prides itself on positive eeriences &amp; values.
Are there still non-stop routes between MDW and SNA? Looking for tickets and there used to be at least 1 non-stop flight per day but not seeing that anymore
"So disappointed with I love flying you guys, but your choices for CLE-TPA suck. I might give someone else a try this time. <U+2639>"
has not given me satisfaction. Left me hanging in Chicago the day after valentine's day. You should be ashamed of yourself for your mishandling of our flights.

Been A List for over 5 years (my choice to fly SWA) and today was the first time a gate agent thanked me for being A List (earned companion last yr). Felt nice.

I am an A-List preferred member. The internet service rarely works or works adequately anymore. I hope that SWA is making changes to improve. Its no longer a great benefit.
any reason why flight 624 is not identified as delayed when the flight prior is just now de-planing?

Pretty sure just made me pay $8 for internet that blocks any kind of streaming outside of their own. Cant watch Netflix or xfinity.
apparently it is ok that the boarding system separated my family with two minor children by over 70 people. I tried to resolve by phone but customer relations is gone till Monday....

Big thanks to the team from to Phoenix for letting our 5 year old see the cockpit. He loved it!
. I am A-List and your airline split me and children (8 and 11). Your gate agent at A11 at BWI at 2pm was totally unhelpful in keeping my family together. Awful customer service. He substituted policy for brains

I am on the plane now () and I left it at the Gate A16 (even though I left from Gate A18).

Beautiful departure from MSP today
"It is pretty inconsiderate for your flight attendants to make comments about how hot the passengers are, to sing, and to call each other baby girl on the intercom. Mutual respect for shared space should be more of a priority."
My husband and I had tickets to Austin from DCA and back. I didn't make the flight from DC to Austin but showed up in Austin and found out my ticket was cancelled for the return. You stole my money and charged me over $300 to get home. Thieves.
any update on Flight 1423 out of DCA? All of us have been sitting on plane for two hours. No updates on a departure time.
What is the phone number format for requesting text alerts on ? Is it XXX-XXX-XXXX?

Great job to Baggage Dept in Detroit and Cinci! You called and let my son know each time his suitcase arrived and it was waiting for him in Cinci. Too bad he had to miss his U of Mi audition Friday due to flight cancellations from ATL. A bonus ticket would help him!

don't fly they're so disorganized and unhelpful. i've never had such a bad eerience with an airline and i've been on more flights than i can count. the employees are so rude and dismiss everyone's frustration like we haven't been trying to get home for 16 hours
thank you for the apology and the coming LUV voucher! No doubt the fog wasnt your fault but the free voucher will allow me to see my family one extra time during our long transition! #makinginconveienceworthit

Hey On flight 2917 here in pdx you got a couple that flat out lied about where there SO was in order to hold an exit seat for their c group partner. Not cool. Especially for those of us who are actually tall.

Extremely unhappy with in FLL. First they would not allow Holland America Bags program for flights after 5...now they wont take bags until 4 hours before. Hundreds of people stuck outside security.
"So, , you issued me a security document instead of a boarding pass. Whats up with that?"
Nothing like being embarrassed on a flight just now because I have a reserved 2nd seat. Thanks for a horrible start to my birthday vacation. All my flights are on SA and this has already been the worst. Ugh.

is the worst airline. the whole C boarding group was unable to board the flight due to bad weather. If weather is an issue shouldnt the flight be cancelled?Clearly they overbooked the flight and didnt want to compensate 60 people. Just lost a customer.

"Emailed Southwest Friday morning about a HORRIBLE eerience - 2 cancelled flights, 3 connection re-route, 36+ hour delay - still no response #GreatCustomerService #NOT"
Why would I only have until the purchase date to redeem travel funds?! Terrible policy considering people buy flights months in advance as in my case. Really makes me want to cancel my SW card.
First time ever flying and my flight was cancelled...great day to sit at the airport for 9 hours.
It's a good day when you notice the price of your flight goes down. Good thing doesn't charge change
"love you most, but not at the moment. 6am flight is now 7:30 total game changer for the meetings today."

"any plans to update your apps for international booking? Figured it would come with the combined reservation system, but hasnt happened yet!"
Our outbound flight had changed w weather cancellations and now it seems our return flight doesnt have early bird? We paid for both ways. Can you check please?
"Hi, Im a new customer and had to cancel an itinerary with an early bird access purchase. I rebooked to change the return date, but that purchase wasnt applied to the new reservation. Do I just lose that $30 or can you please apply it to the new reservation?"
I dream of a day when KC to Denver flights arent completed packed all the time.
Would it be possible for you to hire gate agents who actually speak English? Or is that too eensive?
"On SWA945 FLL-MCO today with Angela, Michael and Patrick. Lots of LUV from this crew. Thank you!"

cant print boarding pass or download. Please help
why do you load a plane push back at 7:23am to de-ice being the only plane waiting and nothing. Then 3 more planes push and get de-iced before we do. Flt 1408 was delayed by an hour and now there is no way for me and 2 other coworkers to make our connection.

you cancelled two of my flights out of Midway last week and I still haven't been refunded
"Mistakenly booked my return flight a month late, and it'll cost me to fix it. It didn't cost you to delay my arriving flight by six hours though. Can you help?"
"welp! not too elated with Southwest right now. Apparently I can't even use travel funds for a close relative. So, more padding of their pockets."
"LOVE flying with you! Love your funny announcements. You made my day 2 weekends ago. 12-hr day, flying/waiting, incl 4-hr layover, Chicago. Delays, snow. 4th-leg attend. made me LOL. But, plz tell pilots, attends. to slow down talking, for hearing-imp. passengers."

"In the last 20 mins, I have changed my twice. And it's telling me ""oops"" - what gives? So annoying."
how on earth to you delay a flight 3 hours and then decide to move it back with 30 minutes notice. Disgusting. Worst airline ever!! Never ever have I had a worse eerience. You are the WORST!!
if there is an offer for RR points for staying at partner hotels- do those count towards companion pass?

when someone pukes on the plane... have it aired out! This flight from Louisville to BWI will be miserable! #Disappointment #grhhh
flying from DCA to MDW to PHX tomorrow. Any 737 MAX flights planned on any of those legs?
"Two planes, a two hour delay, flight attendants liquoring up the entire flight and now another delay upon arrival? Lots of people screaming and the flight attendants are singing over the intercom. Never flying with you again! Where is the professionalism?"
#flight3459 diverted 4 Maintenance. Crew was amazing. 3 hrs added 2 trip. $800 in credit in my inbox when we land. #thankyou

The number of high schoolers on this flight is very disconcerting. Im disconcerted! Free drinks for all of the adults seems fair. #SerenityNow
"There's supposedly one extra person on my flight than there's supposed to be, but they have no way to figure out who it is without comparing the entire passenger manifest to IDs. Not optimistic about solving this."

. on flight 439 and flight attendants are having the same issue identifying what passengers are on board as on 2/16 flight 416. Horrendous customer eerience on one of the busiest travel weekends of the winter.
WN1050. Screen says boarding but no staffs at the counter??? A supposedly 6pm flight after getting delayed multiple times.
help!! I left my iPad on my flight from Houston to Memphis (#1266) today - what do I do?!
Hey ... you are not my friend tonight. We may reunite but for now theres a great deal of angst and frustration.
Sitting in plane for an hour while they hand check everyones IDs because there is a stowaway? No updates from crew. Can you tell me whats happening? HAVE THEY CAUGHT THE STOWAWAY?! Also when are we leaving? Im bored. Flight 286 SJO to PHX
If you can hold flight 334 for us it would be appreciated. Long delay here because they can reconcile the number of people on the plane with the number of scanned boarding passes. #donotwanttosleepinphx
Sitting on for the past hour....still havent left the gate....plane is sweltering too.....#unhappyflyer
"Disappointed in in Customer Support today. I paid for extra points to combine w/ RR for flight home tonight. System took my money, didnt process points and now I am stranded with no flight home tonight. Response? Im sorry, nothing we can do. Wont fly SWA now!"
can we vote to go ahead and fly without air conditioning? #paperworkreally?
you sure rock
"prepare for unhappy passengers on flight 983 out of Nashville. Pass thru...no, gate 16...no, 7...no, 4...no, 16 - and you need a new plane now and it is late. I'm blaming Nashville for now..."
"When you get to see the place you work while in the air, priceless"
So excited to be back on tomorrow! This time as #AList I truly love this airline.
please read.
Flew Baltimore to St Louis to Ft Lauderdale on yesterday and brought a bag of candy for the crew; they work hard and deserve a little appreciation. #luv

Do yall fly to #Wakanda?
Very disappointed in the normally-wonderful continuing to delay flights for operational reasons wit
I booked airfare for a friend and screwed up the time. Flight is in two days is there anything I can do to change this. Feel horrible!
is it too late to cancel a flight departing on Wednesday night?
we've been on hold forever. Got a text our flight tomorrow EARLY AM was cancelled. Need to get ahold of someone now. Please respond.
- not feeling the #LUV today with every LAJC flight delayed with no elanation and no help re-booking. I could have driven home more quickly! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9>
Trying to see how to book a flight online using my southwest gift card. No option to redeem it or use on flight I have saved in my account. Help?
Hey ....am I allowed to bring food (snacks) on the plane for my children? Thanks!
Wow you cancel my flight via email at 9 pm for a 6 am flight with no elanation and no offer to help rebook. Thanks for nothing
Another flight and another delay. Seems like a daily occurrence for me. One saga among many today is a last minute gate change but no gate agent in sight. Thats a new one. Who knows how long this delay will be. Thinking a while. Yeah me
my estimated on-hold time has been less than 2 minutes for about 30 minutes. Any chance of talking to anyone in your customer service department before my flight takes off in 22 hours?
Hey ! Is your website down or is it a user error? I need to book a flight and it wont work <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0094> (and I wont fly another airline!)
Ive been watching the fare for a flight from atl to fll for 2 wks. Only $20 change. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E>
delayed and ran to make my connection over a broken coffee maker?! At 7pm no less. Thanks so much for a great eerience for this frequent business traveler. Delta next time. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0092>
"I used your call back service instead of waiting on hold and you guys have called me back 3x already, but you guys hang up as soon as I answer?"
"just got a test saying my flight #459 tomorrow out of ATL is cancelled, but website and app say its still a go? Which is it?"
landing but not being able to get off the plane is NOT BEING ON TIME!!!!
Just got on flight 369 about to leave Nashville to Chicago Midway Airport time to head home
"Dear , after this morning's almost 2 hours away to get out of San Francisco to Phoenix I'm beginning to think you want to break up with me. I love you but I find it difficult to continue this way. Solutions?"
This hour delay giving me a quick reminder why I don't fly anymore.
Finally on the ground 2 hours later than eected. Thanks for the incompetence
Congratulations !!! Hoping Ill get an invite to interview for Flight Attendant soon. #LuvSouthwest #DreamCareer
Lucky to have made it home tonight! #Denver #SnowStorm Thank you for getting home safe
"I'm not sure how it worked out, but thanks for waiting on my wife's connecting flight so she could come home and see her two girls (and me)!!! #Love"
can I bring my plastic crochet hooks on the plane? I know metal and wood are not allowed but what about plastic?
trying to sign up for the Chase exclusive promo from your app. Keeps failing !
Hey are you even open? Calling to buy a ticket; said two minute wait. been waiting 30!?!?
your mobile boarding pass should have the gate and have it update in real time! Same with delays. Step it up
"how long of a wait is your current customer service help line? It told me a less than 2 minute wait, and I've been on hold for 20 min"
can I transfer miles to my son's avcount?
looking to book airfare for oct but apparently you cant get your act together and have availability like the other airlines do.
"hi! i think i may have left my passport aboard of one your airplanes back on feb 5th, that was a direct flight to BUF #wn777"
what are the points good for?????
"So happy to have my suitcase back. Another passenger took it, I assume, by mistake. Thanks for the way you handled this for me."
What good are the points?
Got the socks. Thanks for a nice surprise
"Flight 563 is, in fact, NOT on time. So why are you still claiming it is? Why were customers not informed until the very minute boarding was supposed to begin that the flight would not be departing on time, after all?"
"Hi, I just tried to book a flight but I received an error message and no flight confirmation email, but Paypal still deducted money from my account. Is calling the best way to get help or can I send an email since the call wait time is long?"
A different agent said it was snowing in Dallas and the plane was delayed bc it had to be de-iced. I elained to her that was impossible as it was 74 degrees in Dallas. SW was once a great airline.
"after 6 delays, an unnecessarily long ID check, offloading to tar mat &amp; refusing to provide my wife with a hotel voucher after being provided horrible customer service...safe to say youve lost a faithful customer. Today was a joke."
Gee thanks first you cancel my mom's flights causing her to lose a day with her new baby grandson. Then you mess up her return so that she can't check in and has to spend two hours trying to get it resolved. #notfixed #CustomerService
"Lousy service, lousy airline. Got a $154 refund for a last-minute cancellation that was NOT attributable to weather. Cost me $354 to rebook with delta &amp; 5 extra hours travel. SWAir Won't even email confirmation of refund."
how do you determine what type of peanuts you serve on your flights?
"I am dying to know, is my first drink free today because its Presidents Day?"
"Im on a fight that is taking an unnecessarily long time to board because everyone is saving seats, you have children separated from parents on a 100% full flight. Perhaps assigned seating would fix this problem."
Thank you so much for helping my friend get aboard a flight after a hellish security line at !

Hey um Im trying to book a flight n it keeps giving me an error code. Just want to get away.
you lost our business yesterday when a physically able 22 y/o girl preboarded and saved the first row. Your lack of policy regarding this just incentivizes indecent people of the world to take advantage of those of us who did the right thing and paid $80 to upgrade
of course your website is down. Glad I dont need to book a flight to see my newborn daughter.
how full is flight 162 to MDW from DCA?
"I get a text that my flight in 2 hours is cancelled, go to your website to rebook- it's not working and now no one at customer service is answering? I have a baby, are we really supposed to go all the way to the airport to get some help?"
what gives? Cancelled flight in line at the airport and on infinite hold with customer service. #nothappy
Is your App down? Cant book a flight!

"Neither rain, nor sleet, nor even snow, right ? Thanks for taking care of us again!  #LoveField"
Really appreciate the cancellation this morning followed up by the rerouting all over the country and a full day of flying for what should have been a 2 1/2 hour flight. Disappointing

Making matters worse I cant understand anything. Something about cooking spaghetti. #slurredspeechwhat #drunkpassengers

Big Fail SW. got to PIT in time to change flight to earlier one to MCO. Was told 3:00 had no availability and put on standby for 4:50 through ATL. At 2:55 the ns 3:00 flight was announced as having open space but flight closed. Now in ATL with no hope
a huge thank you to your dedicated employees who went above and beyond to get me home for a sudden death in my immediate family. #myheros #Iflysouthwest
#relax kids have been yelled at for being too loud. Passengers being threatened to have police meet them at a gate. Because people are trying to sleep :30pm from Boston to Georgia. Most awkward and unenjoyable SW flight ever.

"We booked our flight for our wedding but we just decided we want to go a day earlier, can we switch our flights????"
cant thank enough for getting me home to my mom last minute at a decent price
What is going on with Southwest?! EVERY flight Ive had drop off or pick up duty for lately has been late! Like 8 times in the past month. You guys used to be so good!
do you guys offer military discount for flights
"That moment when switches your flight, tells you dont worry about your bags being on the new flight, and then doesnt get your bags on the new flight... The night before you have an interview that you worked your whole life to get. #TimeToFindANewAirline #sadface"
Not one on time flight today causing us to be rushed on the plane and no space for preboarders who need the time. They say they're towing a plane to the gate. What's up? #Buffalo #Baltimore #Atlanta
"There's an owl taking up a cpl seats on my flight to MSP... kinda cool, no complaints but my dog is a little jealous back home. Owl he wants to do is fly. #puppyrights"
ILY but your policy on traveling before credit from a canceled flight eires is unrealistic! Especially when Im booking 2 months before the actual eiration and traveling only 2 weeks after! So upsetting <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093>
Boarding second leg on to San Antonio for #ccc47 critical congress. Thanks for a good first flight

A day late on posting this beautiful sunset as seen from my seat on plane ride home yesterday.
how long does it take to get paperwork so we can fly out of LAX? You were late getting in you should have had it ready. Let's go!!!!
"RE early bird checkin, how do you determine what seats to give us? We always seem to get down in the B category. Don't understand the process"
in Little Rock waiting on Flight 1156 to Dallas. Our gate agent was amazing and very professional. Thank you for always making the fun eerience pleasant!
You should be sending vouchers to passengers when you have people boarded and ready to go and then announce a one and a half hour delay
Anyone recommend a good alternative to ? I am happy to pay more.
Horrible flight Dallas to KC 545 departure. Delayed on attendants. delayed more adding fuel after flight was ready to go even though plane at gate for 45 minutes. WiFi on flight unreliable. Topped off by attendants chose no service even though no turbulence <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
Aaaaand now we are removing connecting passengers from the plane. Dear please let me go home tonight.
Do a better job of taking your passengers to their destinations!
i owe you all an apology. the flight staff yesterday on my LGB to SAC flight were awesome - seating was super tight though (i sat next to an overweight passenger). today i went to pay for faster seating and they hooked me up due to yesterday's flight KUDOS!
"Get your act together , I want my wife to come home. Deal with the scratch on flight 444 and get underway."

And now they've told us we can't even get off the plane for food because everything in the is closed. At 8pm.
I thought the animals in the fuselage were are supposed to be in a cage?
I guess I need to quit booking my flight home on 5410. This is the third plane swap in 6 weeks. Home 3 hours late again.
", youve failed us on flight 4876. Whyyyyy?"
"second flight this week where A-list Preferred wifi access didn't work. ""504 Gateway Timeout"" #WN6260 - I hope your techs are looking into it."
"Hey - this was taken on one of your planes,I give you permission to use it in an ad <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>"
I'll never fly again after this joke of a delay. So much for getting home at a reasonable time.
", you should consider updating your passengers now and then when you leave them sitting on a runway for 2+ hours!"
My hubby like clouds so I took a few pics for him from my . BWI --&gt; MDW --&gt; MSP
Haven't flown in such a long time and I'm getting a headache already. Help.
62 percent to A list by Feb? Ill take it ...
"A-List Preferred WiFi log in keeps timing out/failing on 2444 MDW-SAT. I entered my card number and it works when I pay! 1) can you fix it, &amp; 2) can you refund me?"

Thanks alot . I love spending 9 hrs in DEN on my vacation. Little more transparency next time please.
Only ONE $59 flight from OKC...to Dallas? Share the love! #giveokiessomeoptions
can your employees get their stuff together. Being told I can't file a claim a bag that didn't make it when at my at my layover they told me to make a claim at my final destination. Ridiculous. #ineedmyluggage
"Hey , as an A-List customer I wouldn't at all mind if you allowed active military to board the plane before us as opposed to letting them board after Group A with the family boarding group. Just a thought!"

Getting excited for our flight to Florida tomorrow. Baby Bryce will have officially flown with four times before his first birthday
"had the most amazing Flight Attendant, Chadwick, on flight 4013 to MCO on Mon 2/19. Last flight home 4 the night &amp; delayed &amp; knew we wouldnt land until close to 12am. But he was HILARIOUS, so kind &amp; helpful! Hes why I love flying SW Air!"
need to talk to customer relations at corp. hq in Dallas as rx by a really helpful operator. Called and the wait time was 54 minutes. Hung up. Called later and it was 72 minutes. Really? What kind of customer relations is that??
Note to self avoid flying both flights never offered anything to drink after waking up from a nap and the flight attendants refilling the ppl next to me and NEVER offered snacks... now sitting for 20 minutes on the ground
Yall did you know had cookies!?
Yall shouldnt tell your passengers youll hold the flight...and then dont actually do it. TERRRRRRRIBLE customer service. Its also weird when the plane were supposed to be on is still sitting at the gate...take responsibility for your delays and cancellations!
"Q: For flyers who do big carry-ons. If you're bringing a bag that is big/fragile for overhead bin, will an A54 boarding pass likely mean you will find space? /I never overhead bin so I have no idea."
Stuck at the airport &amp; everyone misses their connecting flights tonight but somehow makes it a party <f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0089> LOL #lockinattheairport
"Seriously ? How does it make sense for you to allow ""saving seats?"" An ""early bird"" fee or other early-board status should allow the holder to secure ONE seat. Their own. Otherwise you bait-and-switch later early-bird boarders. Your failure to ban begs for a lawsuit."
how do I apply travel funds on the app? I cant seem to find it! #help #please

"shady move by you guys. I had a RT flight selected in my cart, filled out family info, pressed purchase and it conveniently wasnt available because the outbound price was raised by more than double."
How do I figure out where my flight credits are from refunded flights?
3+ hours on flight 444 waiting to take off. All for safety but why are they holding us hostage in this thing with no food drinks or ability to charge phones. I dont want a voucher. I want my money back!
Way to drop the ball on not holding flight 616 out of BWI I've been on flight thst you held longer that the 10 min tonight
"Okay, so is it or responsible for all these delays? One of you owes me a margarita. #NationalMargaritaDayJustice"
"Please dont send a text to a plane full of angry people waiting for the plane to leave, unless you are certain it will wave at this time."
Thanks for the updates and being so great when NYC loses power! #snacks
I love but their lack of notifications on delayed flights is ridiculous.

"Thank you employee Amber who helped my sister over the phone to change her flight so she can be with the entire family due to unfortunate family situation, she was a true angel. Always flown and it will never change during our life. Thank you."
Why does always lie about sitting on the tarmac? Comical.
". the pain continues. First hotel voucher at aloft a disaster. Finally found someone at baggage svcs who gives us La Quinta, but only 1 room... for 5 ppl! Heartless?"
I could walk to Burbank faster than this
"thank you for finding my daughters luggage, we appreciate you!"
"Delay after delay today, with no elanation, I eect more from you."
"finally landed in Nashville. 7 hours from San Antonio to Nashville. Set on tarmac for 3.5 hours because of a scratch on the plane. The crew was great but I'm not too impresssed with SW policies. They didn't let us off the plane, didn't offer free wifi or cocktails."
Why do I get this error trying to to accept an offer on Rapid Rewards?
Should designate bin space according to seating. Someone in the front row with no overhead space shouldnt go 15 rows back and hold up the whole plane while she goes to retrieve it.
Finally got to fly with the best pilot #paultrembeck
...Thanks for loosing my luggage for about 11 hours and then returning it to my hotel soaking wet a quarter till midnight. Nice customer service.. <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BE>

is this allowed on your flights? Its a back up battery charger for my phone.
Im so annoyed with . One of my luggage items is missing. 3rd issue in the past year. And only an insincere apology welll its not like we did it on purpose
Awesome has us trapped on a plane in LAX where a woman is having a panic attack. Meanwhile two planes have landed and made it to their gate. WOW...just wow.

I love your transfarency. Your airplanes are clean and your crews kind. But you need to figure out baggage claim. Waiting an HOUR for my bags is not good customer care. #consistentlyslow #figureitout #servicefromtoptotoe

Hello! Id like to write a review about an eerience I had with a flight attendant on my flight. No worries.. only good things to say! Wanted to give her some recognition. How do I go about that??
is the rain causing flight delays? Been on board for almost an hour but still sitting at gate. Pilot says runway instructions changed - but beyond that not much more info?
My first flight was when I was 2 weeks old.
Still not sure why has you fly from Dallas to Denver to get to Cabo. Makes for a LONG day.
knocked customer service out of the ballpark at 6am today when ONT flight to DAL got sidetracked by a mechanical. Super-efficient rebooking of connecting passengers. #welldone

So dissapointed by never flying again! Was embarassed and mistreated by multiple staff members. Worst flight ever

"Okay TY, she does have an RR account already.... what next?"
Are you really trailing a new Companion Pass check in procedure that requires the pass holder to check in in person with their companion at the ticket counter? At which time your companion gets a security document and require them to check in again at the gate?

my niece wants to be a flight attendant - just graduated from a community college in Missouri - would be a solid Southwest asset (shes a great kid) Any advice?

Your service out of AUS and HOU has been an absolute disaster tonight. How about an attempt at service recovery?? I literally could have driven 7 hours home and beat your aircraft.
"Me: hi : whats up Me: I drank 14 bud lights at a wedding reception and then tried to log into my account with a password I havent used since the 5th grade so then I got locked out and still need to check in : cool happens all the time, C39."
Lots of turbulence this evening. Free in flight drinks help calm my nerves. Thank you

A lot of wasted time sitting on the tarmac today SMH
is so photogenic. #southwestairlines #iflyswa #phkyharbor #nikonphotography 2
You all are starting to act like the rest of airlines. You had space on an earlier flight from Love to AUS &amp; wanted $200 from my wife. 10:30 flight is delayed &amp; wont get home until after midnight. #LosingFaith
"Appreciate the gesture, but maybe time to reconsider only offering drink vocuhers as a reward in business select, or for loyalty (often receive bundles by mail). 30% of Americans dont drink alcohol.. thats 100 million people! Im one of them."

"Listen, the crew on flight 4715 LAX&gt;MDW need HUGE raises. So fun and hilarious. Make a long travel day go by so fast! I wish they were my crew on every flight. Crew like this are what keep me coming back to SW!!"

"OMGosh, the odor coming from the dude next to me on my flight!!!"
Hey - my WiFi worked exactly 2 minutes of the 240 minute flight I was just on. How do I go about getting a refund?
you sent our luggage to Baltimore so your agent told us it would be delivered to us at 10:30pm...It's now midnight and not here yet. I did call for an update and the other agent I spoke to was not helpful at all...#smh

"Flight 2322, Denver to Houston, 1am arrival had one of the loudest group of flight attendants Ive ever eerienced. Zero consideration for passengers. Places passengers in awkward situation if they want to complain."
"I dont always fly domestic but when I do, I prefer"
The check in at IAD is a joke.
"Lost &amp; Found Updater link is broken, last item on"
"Im so sad yall are leaving Flint airport, our gate attendant is playing morning trivia and Im gonna miss these days."

"hi if we feel uncomrtable and threatened boarding a flight b/c of an emotional service animal on the plane, do we have any recourse? Can I be reimbursed?"
whats it take to get some drink tickets....
Love the efficiency of an early morning crew. Jetsetting and #trailblazing from coast to coast for clients. #consultantlife
Hey thanks for not telling us at the time that we would not be able to transfer the ticket that had to be cancelled due to an emergency surgery at the time to someone else's name. Looks like maybe I will look at using a different airline going forward
Cant believe my 7am is delayed almost an hour! There goes my work day...
thank you for the fun birthday song it brought a much needed smile to my face
Wondering why the fuel was not properly done for our plane thus causing us to wait 30 minutes (and counting) waiting to take off? You're better than that.
"hello I have a booking question, I have a RT booked but want to cancel the outbound but cant figure out how, there is companion associated with flight I realize I have to change that one first, but having problem figuring out."

"Among the many things my brain just cant handle, choosing a seat on has to be near the top of the list."
I sure wish would allow us to upgrade boarding position for a connecting flight from an orientating flight boarding agent...
Sooooo the wanna get away option for is basically a standby option? Am I understanding this correctly?
I paid for early bird check in and got A48 and A42. Why?

I need to discuss a canceled flight with someone but can't make a phone call right now because I'm at work. Can someone help me through DM?
another late departure this morning sw519 Omaha to Midway. De-icing again. Plane was waiting at the gate for hours before departure. Why isn't Southwest de-icing these right before departure so we can leave on time? This is become a pattern. #southwest #delayed
Tried to get pretty sunrise pics but was slacking on the window washing
customer service agents should have the ability to provide a greater level of help than directing concerns over promotional sale issues to a web form. Not a great eerience up front with the purchase or when seeking help.
You should train your staff to confront passengers with oversized carry ons. It is starting to get ridiculous.
"Ive been a A-list for years, miss it by 3 flights last year and this is my reward? #loyaltyfail 9"
is there a way to tell why my flight credits are only good for 3 months?!
"Thank you 4 handling our slight emergency beautifully! Had engine trouble on our flight, super scary, but your pilots rocked!"
A HUGE thanks to Henry for helping me get an alternative flight home due to an emergency. Service like this is why I always fly Southwest.
Flown 4-5 times this year already and every plane seems brand new. Kudos for keeping up on cabin maintenance
Thank you Melody for making an early morning flight worth the wake-up time! You were hysterical and I appreciate the laughs!
I need to update my name on my Rapid Rewards account to my new married last name. How can I do this? Is there an email I can send a copy of the marriage certificate to?
Had a great eerience with customer relations today! Luv flying SWA!
"Another Monday, another morning at with . Being voluntarily delayed a bit this morning means I can get some coffee before rebooked flight."
Hi I have a question about an already booked flight.
at what point do you decide a plane cant be fixed and its time to switch planes?

Wanted to give tremendous props to yesterday for a hassle-free change of flight when I saw our connecting flight got delayed 3 hours and I was like aw hale naw. You folks rock!
"has really showed out this weekend. They bumped me and my friend to another flight early Wednesday morning, lost two of my bags in the process, didn't track it at Love Field, and then eect me to keep enjoying this A-List trial? What's the point??! #DoBetter"
I hope you will refund me for the extra $ I had to spend to get home yesterday. Would have missed my connection so flew into a different airport and had bring us to SJC and pay for extra parking
I paid for round trip flight using points. To change reservation will require more points. Is there anyway I can just make the change with $$ instead of buying more points?
Thanks for cancelling my flight home at the last minute with no apparent reason. At least you made it easy to rebook for a later flight.
Hi unfortunately I flew with you yesterday and you lost my luggage now you have no record of my luggage. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0097>
I love the consistency in your departure times. Its either the door closes with 10minutes until departure time or you arrive to your location45 minutes late because of a transferring flight. Great customer service too! Sells my seat before the door closes.
So will let me bring a dozen tamales on a plane
Looking to book a there-and-back flight Saturday just to fly... any suggestions for cheap awesomeness this Saturday 3/3? <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0099><U+2764><U+FE0F><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009B>

Just spotted a 737 on approach to this new or is something amiss?
seriously preboards are saving seats now???
SO preboards able bodied adults ( mystery about WHO they are??) then save front row seats for friends in B boarding group??
WE are using a DIFFERENT Airline for our Trip to COSTA RICA for the FIRST TIME EVER. YOUVE been our Favorite. BUT Why did you discontinue NON-STOP FLIGHTS on RETURN? We are using a different CARRIER for our UPCOMING TRIP. THE 8hr to 11:45 hr travel time TOO MUCH.
in is the best! First class in customer service from agents I'Tangella and PaRee.
Hey what's the best way to complain about how exceptionally rude your PHX staff are today?
hey SWA team! Cant seem to book any travel to Havana or Belize despite the schedule showing availability. Please advise
Oh hello Chicago! great day for a flyover
my cousin suffered a spinal cord and will be transferred from OU med to a facility in Denver tomorrow. Is there a representative I could speak with regarding possible flight vouchers to assist her husband and son in joining her?
being awesome today with no flight delays for my flights! #blessed
"That excitement when your tax refund posts and you can buy your tickets to go to Mobile, AL (via Pens"
"If I had booked the flight just put me on, I wouldnt have missed it because boarding is already 20 minutes delayed"
"Total BS. I pay $15 extra to board early. I get B12 which is fine, but then they let 28 yes 28 people with kids board before me after the As. If youre going to take my $ let me board early!"
Having a great flight #2014 with Ms Therese today! A real professional and a credit to your team!
Thanks for following up with me regarding my delayed Flight last week and thanks for the Luv voucher.
I cannot log in for the life of me. Can you help me?
Wow. So not happy right now... first flights are delayed... then go to get my luggage from baggage claim to find this... my suitcase ripped apart.
"Last year had on a plane for Texas Independence Day and we survived Harvey, even winning the World Series. My suggestion? We go bigger this time. Ask not what Texas can do for you, but what you can do for Texas."
thanks for ruining my wedding by not allowing my maid of honor to use her credit. You're supposed to be the airline of customer service. What a joke.
I have some travel funds eiring soon. Is there anyway to extend the eiration if I can't use it by that date
Thanks for a safe flight back from San Francisco to Burbank yesterday
Can confirm: service has continued to decline. Paid for WiFi that never worked. Bought an early bird check-in that got me B-nothing. Treated rudely by several employees. Happy to be pushing my business to and
Approx 20min to boarding my flight to SLC. Honored and grateful to be chosen by for a Digital Academy scholarship. New life starts now! &lt;3

SHAME ON YOU FOR HIRING THIEVES. YOU SHOULD RETURN MY FRIENDS BELONGINGS AND LIVELIHOOD. I HAVE A LOT OF ARTIST FRIENDS IN NASHVILLE AND THEY FOLLOW ME #theywillseethis CAN I GET A RETWEET
"Wow. Look at this insincere response. If really cared as much as they say, they would at least want to know the details of what happened. Apparently they do not."
please get me back to Philly. #thankyou D
I hate the hassle of flying but I get genuinely excited when I get to fly .
thought I would let y'all know how disgraceful it is that you stand behind thieves that u employ. My friends flew to Las Vegas for WORK. Their property worth over $4000 was stolen from bags by SW Air employees. #thieves
I received a LUV voucher the other day from a delay. Can I add it to my online account so I dont have to sweat losing paper copy? Thanks! <U+2708><U+FE0F>
how early before the scheduled departure time can I check a bag at PHX?
"For some reason my Houston to Dallas flight is departing out of Hobbys 3 year old International Terminal (Gates 1-5). This is seriously hitting the airport lottery. Wide open spaces, nice restaurants....did I mention non-congested wide open spaces?"
First time flying this weekend and I must say I was 100% surprised and pleased. Best customer service Ive had recently with an airline &amp; super smooth flights! Thank you for being such a great company and keeping me calm with my flight anxieties! #SouthwestAirlines
"Just want to say your flight crews, pilots, and even people working the counters for boarding are awesome!! They make everything easy, fun, and enjoyable!! Looking forward to my flight to Houston.."
"hi , I wanna get away"
"hi just got my TSA pre, can I add it online to an already existing reserv? thanks!"
The Flight Attendant got us to do the wave. #Southwest #Travel c
Tried to board Flight 176 MDW to LAS and had boarding position A21 and ticket agent wouldnt let me board due to my 5 year old daughter having a B group boarding number. Great way to treat an A list preferred member!
How to upgrade to A 1 to 15 for s flight tomorrow. Already check in and got A55.
Delayed to SLC with no end in sight! Already missed one meeting. Hope I dont miss another one!
please elain why your customer service has drastically been reduced to trash? #hurricanes#travelplanschanged#11dayseired#seriously
I cant stand always delaying at the last minute! This is the 7th time! So frustrating!
"flight 1194 LAS to PIT was delayed an hour, supposed to leave at 1035 now 1045 still sitting here no one talking. Think thered be a little urgency? Any idea if were leaving soon?"
Traveling is all fun and games until your baggage gets lost

i really need these sale fares to go anywhere in the northeast
Wasnt that a plane flying over Charleston WV today and landing ? Dont see that very often.
"<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D> . Rolled through security at 1:42 pm right near the gate for a 2 pm flight from RDU to HOU (mine scheduled one was at 5:20), got switched to the 2 pm, got $4.20 back for the fare change and was on the plane by 1:52 pm..."
Another great flight You are my favorite all time airline!!! Love you guys and gals. 
Please bring back the 6am CMH to BOS non-stop flight. AM nonstop beats PM. This pic from Sept 28 is proof
Turned C17 boarding position into a miracle window seat #blessed
Calling the airline is never stressful when its had great service from Vanessa today. Her computer wasnt wanting to cooperate but she was patient and spent plenty of time on the phone with me to get all my travel needs worked out and fixed.
Omg Michael on the DEN -&gt; SNA flight this morning was FANTASTIC. This is why I luv y'all!
Hey I just travelled for work and need some assistance because I need a receipt for my early bird!

do you have any plans to renovate your LGA terminal? Everywhere else I fly with you is pretty wonderful except where I live where it feels like I'm in some sort of airport jail with 1 bathroom. Not ideal
Hello! I do not have any KickTails with me (shame on me). Can I get one for Lisa in flight 1202 from MDW to LGA?? She is delightful and has made me forgot your total screw up week before last.
Bruh I kno did not just cancel my whole ass flight 2 hrs before it leaves. Got me the airport smh
"hey guys, I'm trying to update a reservation and am in need of a little help."
attn rapid rewards &amp; SW cc customers..beware SW hotel bookings are not linked to phone app so doesnt show up on trips also may redirect you to a 3rd party booking site. I only realized this recently<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
"your WiFi is useless. $8 and a 4-hr flight later, the signal was never strong enough to download or send a single email. With the signal going in and out so much, I would have been more productive working completely offline. Not a one-time occurrence either."
please do the right thing and give some sort of compensation for flight 1156 sna to sac. Passengers have lost the afternoon of work due to mechanical issues that your agents informed us happened with this plane last week.
"Looking good, ! #OneTeamAllHeart"
Okay Im digging your new planes <U+2708><U+FE0F>

"I paid for early bird check in and when I check it on my app , I get a B boarding pass??? Thats ridiculous!"
"Can you tell me if flights 1972 and 1337 on Thursday have WiFi? If I purchase WiFi on the first flight, does it work on the connecting flight?"
2 of 2 you need to give every passenger on that flight a full refund on the fare. They got messages saying the flight was cancelled after they took off. Not something Id eect from SWA!
Officially checked in for my flight tomorrow! Only thing standing in my way is a day of work and pedicure. #letsdoittoit #givemethatfloridasun
Customer service at DIA in Denver Colorado is terrible!!!! I dont know if Ill fly with you guys again!!!!!
"While I do enjoy the free checked bag, delaying my already short vacation 20 minutes at a time for the last 2 hours with no updates on when a plane will actually be here is getting ridiculous. When will this be corrected?!"
Kudos to at MCO. Late flight and someone grabbed my bag by mistake. Baggage crew were awesome and delivered bag to hotel overnight!
any idea if site being down for on-line check-in is going to be a significant outage? Have a flight later today and will need to plan when I leave for airport accordingly.
"hey thanks for canceling our flight from Dallas to Lubbock, I love leaving from Tulsa earlier and arriving in Lubbock later than I originally planned, also the bonus stop in Austin, TX is a plus. #guesstheflightwasntfull #shouldhaveloadedmyfree2bagswithsand"
can you help? My TSA precheck didnt show up even though i have a trusted traveler number.
How do I use my credit ($172) from a canceled reservation to book another flight? Do I enter in the confirmation # somewhere?
"Why the rapid rewards credit card is the best! Companion pass, no blackout dates, and more!"
Getting a text to rebook and then being unable to do so because the flight is in progress is unbelievable. Auto rebook for 9 hours later is unacceptable.
Hey your crew in Austin checked in a group of 33 in record time! Very impressive!! Thank you!
"letting passengers board 5 minutes after ""departure time"" who are super drunk is a disgrace."
flight to phx cancelled without elanation. What happened?

Wouldn't it be awesome to have an airline that had pet flights! Your dog and or cat could sit on your lap even!

you have cancelled my flights 3 times in 7 days. What the heck!?

Is there anyway I can add 2 individuals to my preexisting flight at the same rate I booked?

why Are flights from PBI to ISP on 3-4 hour delays?
"if tickets I purchased have dropped significantly in price, can I be credited the difference?"
So Twitchcon dates have been announced and doesn't even have tickets available that far in advance

you delay the flight then as we are boarding you take a flight attendant away for another flight and trap us in the hallway bc passengers cant board without 3 flight attendants. Cool.
customer service on Twitter is awesome. Thanks ^CT!

I know its kind of too early but Im taking SWA6421 tonight PHTW. On my southwest app its saying flight is delayed. Is this due to rain and snow at DTW?

Had a great time in Dallas but that doesnt mean I dont want to get home... on a plane and the left engine wont start. Waiting to find out if Im stranded or going to get on another plane. I just want to sleep in my own bed.

Really ? I've been trying to book a flight for over 5 minutes; We are currently unable to complete your request due to an undefined error.
why isnt a companion allowed to board at the same time instead of me giving the same old speech... this seat is taken? Makes no sense and a button of controversy. Let a guy with a 80 lb dog board first as an emotional pet. Hmmmmm
is bogus as hell . Me and my mom looked online for months for a certain date and he prices never changed so we said fuck it and bought the tickets. As soon as we buy them we check again and they were cheaper<f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0083> . Like fuck us right .

Hey how about implementing some QOS on your WiFi to allow those who pay for it to be able to use it without all the buffering.
can I get an update on flight 1994 from Boise to Oakland? I cant see any reason why it would need to be delayed for over an hour
So glad to see flies on windy days.

I want to give HUGE praise to the pilots and crew on today's flight 6242. We landed at BWI in the teeth of that nor'easter. The crew kept the atmosphere light while enforcing seatbelt rules and the pilots handled that nasty wind with great skill. Many thanks to all!
I had a flight in May I had to cancel. I had paid for Early Bird on this trip. I just booked a new reservation for Sept. Wondering if it's possible to get the Early Bird I lost in May credited to the new trip in Sept? Hope so!! Thx!
Thanks again for another trouble-free flight even made up delay time from PHX to SAN!
your 737-8 with sky interior is nice and enjoyable. Your 737-7 with 1990 style interior - dirty and gross! Spend a dollar or two on updating these old turd hearses!!!
Just landed at bwi. Smooth
are you all on your lunch break right now??? Ive been on hold for 50 minutes...?
"By the way, if you select the option to have them call you back due to long hold times, calls and quickly hangs up. #thanksfornothing"

"Ok, . I see you. Digging the relaxing, blue mood lighting &amp; sweet tunes on this new spaceplane from the future! This bad boy still has that new plane smell. , what row are you on? They rushed me up to Row 1 when they detected my heroic back-up pilot vibe d0"
this is a familiar sight. Ten flights in seven days with . I talk about customer service for a living. You live customer service and others talk about it.
its frustrating that agents at my first airport cant help with a business select upgrade on my connecting flight.

Thank you for always kindly accommodating my violin. Your respect for musicians sets you apart from other airlines!
I'm kind of tired of seeing pre board folks with nothing wrong taking prime seats. Pre board should not be able to sit in exit rows or the first row. Not to mention there should not be 10 of them per flight.

how about trying to update the mobile app to allow individual passengers to receive their own boarding pass on their respective phone electronically when more than one passenger share the same confirmation number?
not allowing spouses to use each others travel funds is a bad policy. I canceled my wifes flight that I paid for with my card but I cannot use that credit to book a flight. Doesnt make sense.
Been a loyal customer all my life and now they say my account is disabled and my rewards points are invalid. Wonder if I will have a better eerience flying moving forward. #disappointed
Working my way back to A-List!
Hey hook me up with an in flight massage.. my feet are hurting... lol

Thanks for another great flight! Free bags + Friendly crew like the one on Flight 1496 today = loyal customer
Really not happy with SWA today. Flight (718) canceled supposedly due to weather but other flights are arriving after. Now I have to pay for a hotel and use up my vacay time at work.
dropping the ball this week. Delayed 5 hours yesterday to Chicago and WiFi broken on my return. #soannoying

is just plain and simply the best airline there is. Period.
"Its my favorite day of work travel! Travel HOME day! As usual, will take good"
Its so dumb charges you to transfer points to someone who you live with. Youve already earned the points why should I have to pay to give them to someone.
had the absolute rudest employee help me at the baggage check yesterday. Ive never felt more insulted in my life. Extremely disappointed.
aw youre so cute
Good night my mom flew in today and her luggage smells like dead fish #WTF?!?

"you always pull through. 4 hour flight delay, but you come through with vouchers for passengers. Thanks for always putting us first!"
an hour later &amp; now the plane comes.. gotta be kidding me
How can I check if it has WIFI?
I have a nexus how do I get trusted traveler on my boarding pass.
Glad I purchased the Wi-Fi on my 5.5 hour flight and it was down the whoooollleeee fliiightttttt. I want my money back.
the least you could do is inform passengers regarding delays. Our flight is supposed to leave at 840 from MDW to FLL and everyone is still just sitting around.

your WiFi always sucks!! #fakeadvertising
"What the deuce, - I literally checked in the second I was eligible to, and I got B18!?!? Is good boarding only available to those who pay extra? I generally like flying with you, but you make people feel like baggage when you do this."
Damn flight is delayed 2 hours because they are waiting for a part. Way to ruin our vacation
Per usual is delayed. Can't remember a time I flew SW without a delay. Good thing I'm not in a hurry.

I have a question. Do you guys have different boarding policies at different gates because your managers can't answer that. All they try to do is kick you off a flight when things are done in their order.

When are you guys releasing the next round of flight schedules?

Paid for Early Bird back in January and I checked in today and get B4?!? I dont think it worked at all. Very disappointing. There went $15 for nothing.
Thanks for the update ... finally get an update 30 minutes after we were supposed to leave and 5 MINUTES before the plan is going to take off #nice
not loving this delay from Chicago to Columbus apparently for luggage when the plane has been sitting at the gate for the last several hours... l thought luggage was supposed to be your thing?
why won't you let me check in?! Your customer service is rude!!! You have always been my favorite airline......

"Does the Rapid Rewards program offer a ""family pooling"" option in which members of the same family can pool their earned miles into the same shared account?"

why are you canceling flights to Boston when weather is not lower than 34 degrees in the next 24 hours? My family should get hotel rooms for being stranded in Columbus for no reason.
I have a flight in 3 weeks and need to change my wife's last name on the ticket. She recently changed her name to her married name. I emailed the marriage license and divers licence a few weeks ago and still have not heard anything.
"everything I see online says I should tweet y'all so, I'm tweeting. Recently married, booked a flight in my married name, then the DMV moved my appointment so now I won't have an updated I.D in time for my flight. How can I change my reservation to my Maiden name?"

"Oh, #878. You make me so disappointed"
"Arrived at the gate at the Denver airport 1hr and 10 minutes ago, and still nobody has received ski bags. Could have taken an earlier shuttle to the mountain! Need to improve."
"You've delayed flight 1975 DAL-LAS for nearly an hour becasuse of ""parts for another plane."" What gives? Not cool."
"Hey , why does the app say flight 878 is on time, when the terminal announced that it is 3h delayed?"
"While you're adding stops, I'd love to see a non-stop between Seattle and Detroit so I could stop flying Delta every month."

"what is your policy on dogs cause I would love to have mine sit on my lap too. I know the rules more than the flight attendants?? No peanuts for allergies, dog allergies are not important?"
"I'm going to be flying with you guys soon, just wondering, would a 30in long plushie be allowed as a personal item on the plane? I don't want my plushie to be lonely if I checked it into checked luggage."
I came to know I cannot plan my day because your automated system cancels flight automatically. I reserved flight and it canceled now either I wouldn't fly or I pay you more.
Well you got me to Cali but no luggage!!!!! GEE THANKS!!!
are blankets considered personal items?
Beautiful departure from on this morning...

how do you have a sign for curbside check in and then NOT have an employee working to check bags? I MISSED MY FLIGHT waiting in line TWICE to check a bag.

You know what ? Theres a reason why people pack small roller bags to travel. Because we dont want to waste time at baggage claim nor do I think my 3 day trip requires a ton of luggage. Thanks for ALWAYS being ridiculous and forcing us to check bags. Cant stand it

my flight was cancelled yesterday with super limited notice for no reason. I was able to rebook on another flight but was late for my meeting. Super disappointed and considering never flying SW between SF and LA for business again due to lack of reliability.

Hey - 21 empty sears out of FLL to Houston Hobby &amp; I was told we had to pay $850+ dollars to get on standby list. What kind of highway robbery? Youre discouraging passengers from flying your airline with this inflexible policy.

I wouldnt be surprised if just cancels my flight at this point. Delayed twice and Im only going from CA to AZ. Its not snowing here so seriously what the heck! After my disaster with jet blue Im so over flying #whatgives #soannoying
Very disappointed when the flight is late and you don't do anything to allow people to sit in open seats when you are rushing people to board. Why have boarding order to save seats on a full flight.

flight 1260 from SAN to SFO is a shit show. First of all it got delayed... which I can understand due to weather... but then we had to wait on FREAKIN FLIGHT ATTENDANTS!!! Seriously!? You all should have had plenty of time to figure this out and get them to the gate
